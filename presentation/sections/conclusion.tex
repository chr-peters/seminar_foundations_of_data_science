\begin{frame}{Boosting: From theory to application}
    \begin{itemize} \pause
        \item Boosting originated from a theoretical question \pause
        \item Lead to widely used algorithms \pause
        \item The principles have been adapted and expanded \pause
        \begin{itemize}
            \item e.g. Gradient Tree Boosting is one of the
                most popular ML algorithms today~\cite{XGBoost}
