    \begin{itemize}
        \item ...if it is presented with $m > m_\mathcal{H}(\epsilon, \delta)$ examples \pause
        \item ...has to find a hypothesis $h \in \mathcal{H}$ \pause
        \item ...such that $L_{(\mathcal{D}, f)}(h) < \epsilon$ for every $D$ and $f$ with confidence $1 - \delta$ (if RA holds) \pause

\begin{frame}{Weak learning definition}
    \textbf{An algorithm A is a $\gamma$-weak-learner for a class $\mathcal{H}$, if...} \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ...for every $\delta \in (0, 1)$ there exists a threshold 
            $m_{\mathcal{H}}(\delta) \in \mathbb{N}$, such that \pause
        \item ...if trained on at least $m > m_{\mathcal{H}}(\delta)$ examples \pause
        \item ...it will find a hypothesis $h$, such that \pause
        \item ...$L_{(\mathcal{D}, f)}(h) < \frac{1}{2} - \gamma$
            with confidence $1 - \delta$ \pause
        \item ...for every labeling function $f$ and every distribution $\mathcal{D}$
            (if RA holds) \pause
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{...but how does this help us?}

\begin{frame}{Why we care about weak learning}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We already know that implementing ERM for strong learners can be
            computationally hard \pause
        \item Weak learners don't have to be that accurate (only better than 50\%) \pause
        \item Maybe we can find weak learners that can be implemented efficiently \pause
        \item ...and then use boosting to still end up with a strong learner \pause
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Lets look at an example (Decision Stumps)}
