Even after centuries of research in the field of data science, 
there is nothing more versatile than the useful theorem of chapter~\ref{adaboost}. 
It is used everywhere and has led to the greatest and most intriguing results, cf. \cite{Someone03}. 
By the way, the book for the seminar \cite{SSBD14} is a great reference and should be cited.
Further literature can be found in the respective \emph{Bibliographic Remarks} sections and 
of course you are welcome to search and add your own references.
