\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this article it was shown how a weak learning algorithm can be boosted into a strong PAC learner using the
AdaBoost algorithm.
The hypothesis class of decision stumps was identified to be efficiently learnable using an ERM algorithm, so
it followed that the AdaBoost algorithm is also efficient using decision stumps as the base learner.
