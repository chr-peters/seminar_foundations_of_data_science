\section{Introduction}
This article deals with the fundamentals of data science. We are covering the topic XYZ in particular, 
which is very interesting and besides the theoretical depth has many practical applications.

We start with a definition, which plays a central role in this work.

\begin{definition}{(Euclidean norm)}
    \begin{linenomath*}
	    Let $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$. We denote by $$\|x\|=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i^2}$$ the Euclidean norm of $x$.
    \end{linenomath*}
\end{definition}
